# LibreChurch Website

This site is based on the evie template: Project site: https://evie.undraw.co

An MIT licensed template bundled with a minimal style guide to build websites faster, especially combined with illustrations from [unDraw](https://undraw.co). It is extemely lightweight, customizable and works perfectly on modern browsers.

## Setup

1. Install node and npm
2. Install NetBeans 8.2 (9.0 does not seem to support HTML5/JS and node yet)
3. Checkout the project only using git (without using NetBeans)
4. run ```npm install``` within the project dir
5. Start NetBeans and configure its preferences (HTML5 pane) to make it find npm and node (and gulp)
6. Open the checked out project using NetBeans

## Usage

1. Make your changes within the "src/theme" directory.
2. Click the "build" or "run" button of NetBeans.
3. You'll find the generated site meant to be served/deployed inside the "public" directory.
